ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mynhardtburger

I'm a software engineer and I love solving puzzles. Still in the early stages in my software career, but an experienced corporate worker. Coming from a CPA background together with a datascience diploma I know how to work effectively in teams and turn amorphous goals into actionable plans.

ðŸ“« You can reach me via my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mynhardtb/) profile.

PS. check out my recent project! [Should I Shovel?](https://shouldishovel.com)
