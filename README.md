# About me

I'm a software engineer that came from a career as a CPA. Currently I spend my working hours writing python to build backend data interfaces with security tools at CheckSec. In my free time I work on improving gaining experience with web techologies and building tools to solve common accounting problems.

Check out my recent projects! 
* [recon-cli](https://github.com/mynhardtburger/recon-cli) - Simple command line tool to reconcile datasets
* [Next.js Blog](https://mynhardt.ca) - Simple blog built using Next.js and TypeScript.
* [Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/mynhardtburger/ticktacktoe) - Exploring factory and module design patterns.
* [Etch A Sketch](https://mynhardtburger.github.io/etch-a-sketch/) - A first attempt at CSS Grid layout.
* [Rock Paper Scissors](https://mynhardtburger.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/) - Exploring basic DOM manipulation using JS.
* [Should I Shovel?](https://shouldishovel.com) - Weather app with a twist. I wanted to learn Docker, Terraform and working with large datasets. It ended up that PostGIS was able to provide an elegant simple solution to my raster data problem :)


# Open-source highlights
