ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mynhardtburger

Iâ€™m exploring how to effectively use data. Recently I completed a diploma in data science which introduced me to statistical methods and how those can be applied using python and SQL based technologies. Currently I'm interested in data ops and am learning how to work with and build larger systems.
