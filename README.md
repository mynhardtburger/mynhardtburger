# About me

I'm a software developer that came from a career as a CPA. Currently I spend my working hours writing python to build backend data import functionality at CheckSec. My current learning focus is JS and the web dev process.

Check out my recent projects! 
* [Rock Paper Scissors](https://mynhardtburger.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/) - Exploring basic DOM manipulation using JS.
* [Should I Shovel?](https://shouldishovel.com) - Weather app with a twist. I wanted to learn Docker, Terraform and working with large datasets. It ended up that PostGIS was able to provide an elegant simple solution to my raster data problem :)


# Open-source highlights
* [python/typeshed#9764](https://github.com/python/typeshed/pull/9764): "Additional type hints added to stub openpyxl"
