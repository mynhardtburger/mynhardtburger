👋 Hi, I’m @mynhardtburger

I’m exploring how to effectively use data. Recently I completed a diploma in data science which introduced me to various statistical and machine learning methods and how those can be applied using python and SQL based technologies. Currently I'm interested in data engineering and am learning how to build and maintain larger systems.
